## Setup Instructions 

For setting up the backend environment use the following steps to setup your virtual environment and install the necessary dependencies
Make sure you have python 3 installed. 
Then, 
```git clone <repo>```
```cd <repo>```
```pip install virtualenv``` (if you don't already have virtualenv installed)
```virtualenv venv``` to create your new environment (called 'venv' here)
```source venv/bin/activate``` to enter the virtual environment
```pip install -r requirements.txt``` to install the requirements in the current environment

Make sure you have Node.js installed
Navigate to the front end folder and run
```npm install```
